 <hr />
 <h3>SHREK</h3>
 <P>I’ve sailed the seven seas, and you’re the sleekest schooner I’ve ever sighted. Is that a belayin’ pin in yer britches, or are ye … </br>Suddenly you’re like a pirate, you’re 65 years old and you’ve got an ear- ring.</P>
 <h3>SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS</h3>
 <P>Pardon me, but would ya mind if I fired me cannon through your porthole? </br> It is when pirates count their booty that they become mere thieves.</P>
 <h3>JOHN WICK</h3>
 <P>I’d love to drop anchor in your lagoon. Come show me how ye bury yer treasure, lad! And that was done without a single drop of rum… Pirate’s code: </br> First freedom and the captain. </br> Second the loot, third woman and the rum and at the end no mercy if they not immediately surrender! Without the messy paperwork.</P>
